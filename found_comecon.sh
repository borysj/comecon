echo "1) A post identifier written as a PHP snippet"
echo "2) This code: includes/display_comments.php"
echo "3) This form: includes/form-submit_comment.html â€“ which should contain the full title of the blog post"

echo "instead of index.html and the_new_blog.html."
echo "For more details, see README.md or look into the examples directory."

echo "Every time you regenerate your website, you will have to recreate the symbolic link:"
echo "ln -s /var/www/comecon/comecon.php /var/www/html/comecon.php"
echo "...or something like this, depending on which directories you use."

echo "\nThe comments and the comment form are unstyled, so they will look rather ugly."

echo "\nAlso, remember to register at least yourself and your grandma in private/commenters.php."
echo "Take a look at private/commenters.bak to see how to do it."

echo "\nFinally, remember that Comecon has several optional features and bonus scripts:"
echo "- master comment file"
echo "- comment feeds"
echo "- mail notifications"
echo "- search engine"
echo "- random post selector"
echo "- random quote generator"
echo "You have to activate them manually. Follow the instructions in README.md"
